					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Public Safety: Wearable Tech Ii Transforming Emergency Response</em></h3>
				
					<p>The wearable technology market is expected to grow from $20 billion in 2015 to almost $70 billion in 2025, according to research 
					firm IDTechEx. As commercial applications bloom, more will find their way into the public sector and emergency response(Raths, 2015).</p>
					<img src = "police.jpg" height = "300px" width = "800px"/>
					<p>This year has seen an increase in the number of police departments using body cameras. And already under development 
					are wireless devices that monitor a responder’s breathing, heart rate and blood pressure, as well as potentially 
					harmful environmental conditions, and relay concerns back to incident command(Raths, 2015).</P>
					
					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Transportation and Mass Transit: Big Breakthroughs are just around the Corner</em></h3>
					<p>Nothing is likely to be more disruptive to transportation, mass transit and urban planning than the double 
					whammy of connected vehicle technology and autonomous vehicles(Raths, 2015).</p>
					
					<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation expects great things from the connected vehicles of the future ­— and that 
					future may be just around the corner. Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication capabilities and anonymous information 
					from passengers’ wireless devices relayed through dedicated short-range connections could provide transportation agencies 
					with improved traffic, transit and parking data, making it easier to manage transportation systems and improve traffic safety(Raths, 2015).</p>

					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Parks and Recreation: Tracking Trees For A Better Future</em></h3>
					<p>A combination of advances in mobile data collection systems and geocoding lets natural resources and parks agencies be more 
					proactive about collecting tree data, managing urban forests and quantifying their value, as forests become 
					increasingly important resources in an era of climate change(Raths, 2015).</p>
					<p>Philadelphia Parks and Recreation has added approximately 2 million trees to its database in the past few years. 
					It plans to create a digital management system for all of them. Los Angeles City Parks uses the Davey 
					Tree Expert Co.’s Web-based TreeKeeper management software to manage existing tree inventories and administer 
					work orders. The department can also more easily look at species balance to manage against pests, disease and drought(Raths, 2015).</p>
