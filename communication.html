					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Email</em></h3>
					<p>Although email was invented in the 1970s, it didn’t become widespread until internet service 
					providers started providing service in the 1990’s. When people signed up for service, they were 
					often given an email address for their use.</p>
					
					<p>Soon after, email services such as Hotmail made it much easier to get an email address outside of an ISP. 
					Since then, email has taken over as a major way we communicate with either other professionally and personally.</p>

					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Social Media</em></h3>
					<p>Social media is one of the biggest disruptors to the way we communicate with others. There are many social 
					media networks out there, and most often the average individual is a member of at least three to four of them.</p>
					
					<p>The fact that we signed up for and are members of several social media networks at the same time disrupts the way we 
					communicate in that these networks provide a way to talk to each other without giving out details like a phone number.</p>
					<img src = "social.jpg" height = "300px" width = "800px"/>
					
					<h3 style = "text-align:center"><em>Multiple Avenues</em></h3>
					<p>Much like having several different email addresses and being members of several different social media networks, we often 
					have multiple ways we can be contacted in addition to email and social media networks.</p>
					
					<p>Having different avenues to communicate with each other helps to accommodate others that may prefer certain technologies. 
					Some people may like Skype more than email, while others may prefer a text message over a phone call. Having all of these 
					avenues allows anyone and everyone to contact us the way they want.</p>
