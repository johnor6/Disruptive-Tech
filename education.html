					<p><strong><em>Flipping the class</em></strong> is the popular term for shifting content delivery online, so that class time 
					can be spent in learning activities that better engage students in exploration and application of that 
					content. Typically, this technique involves delivering content through video-based mini-lectures connected 
					to other content from textbooks or online resources. Student accountability can be provided through a “readiness 
					assurance process” that includes short individual tests to ensure students have engaged with the materials 
					before class, followed by small group tests that structure collaborative learning during class. Flipping the 
					class—particularly when paired with team-based learning—is a disruptive instructional innovation because it 
					challenges our assumptions about what happens in a classroom and forces students out of the status quo of 
					passive learning habits.</p>

					<p><strong><em>Learning analytics</em></strong> involves the automated collection and analysis of significant amounts of student data with 
					the goal of delivering actionable class-wide information to the teacher and personalized feedback to the students. 
					Course management systems can gather data about how often students access course content, how they do on quizzes, 
					how frequently they contribute to discussion boards, and other measures of engagement and success. Instructors can 
					use this data to adjust instruction for the entire class or provide additional help to particular students. 
					Advanced systems like Carnegie Mellon’s Open Learning Initiative drill down still further, analyzing student answers 
					to particular quiz questions and providing tailored learning resources in response—including additional content and 
					practice—all while providing instructors with detailed dashboards about individual and class progress. Advanced learning 
					analytics systems are still in their early stages, but they may lead to significant changes in the ways we offer online 
					and hybrid classes, allowing us to reach significantly larger groups of learners while still providing the personalized 
					attention common in smaller courses, the holy grail of both on-campus and online education. With Indiana University’s 
					recently-announced IU Online initiative, this disruptive innovation may become even more important in the future of our 
					university.</p>
					
					<p><strong><em>Electronic textbooks</em></strong>(eTexts) offer an example of a technology that can be seen both as a sustaining and disruptive innovation, 
					depending upon how the eTexts are produced and used. At a basic level, eTexts can simply be a different mode of delivering 
					static content to students, essentially an electronic copy of the printed book. The approach is sustainingly innovative in 
					the benefits it offers, namely portability and lower cost for students, but the eTexts are used just like any other textbook, 
					so few behaviors or expectations change. Disruptive innovation comes into play if that eText and its use are highly interactive—through 
					advanced multimedia or built-in collaborative tools. The Courseload eText platform adopted by IU, for example, allows instructors 
					to track student use of the text, and both teachers and students can share annotations and notes with one another, offering the 
					potential for significantly changing how students engage with their textbooks and classmates.</p>
